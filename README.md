BOUNCY BLAST

The goal of this week's Ironhack challenge is to build a basic but functional game that can be rendered and played in a web browser.
To this end, I chose Pac-Man as the theme for my game. However, I ran into some difficulty understanding exactly how to accomplish what my brain was imagining.

Thanks to the MDN web documents, I was able to find an in-depth tutorial that covered a lot of topics about which I was unsure. 
I credit the MDN developers for creating this project in a step-by-step format that was easy to understand and deploy. 
While the code was provided in chunks and I had the option to copy and paste it, I chose instead to hard code the game myself.
Thus I was able to become much more familiar with the actual development process.
